/* Solidus Dummy app generator creates a vendor manifest in vendor/assets/javascripts/frontend/all
that requires this file: spree/frontend.
Inside solidus_starter_frontend we don't need anything from spree/frontend,
but the file must be there for the dummy application that expects it.
This approach is in order to don't have to make changes in the solidus_core
dummy app generator in the process of developing this extension. */
