    For Visa, MasterCard, and Discover cards, the card code is the last 3 digit
    number located on the back of your card on or above your signature line.
    For an American Express card, it is the 4 digits on the FRONT above the end
    of your card number.

    To help reduce fraud in the card-not-present environment, credit card
    companies have introduced a card code program. Visa calls this code Card
    Verification Value (CVV); MasterCard calls it Card Validation Code (CVC);
    Discover calls it Card ID (CID). The card code is a three- or four- digit
    security code that is printed on the back of cards. The number typically
    appears at the end of the signature panel.
