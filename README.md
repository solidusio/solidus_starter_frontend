# Solidus Starter Frontend
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/solidusio/solidus_starter_frontend.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/solidusio/solidus_starter_frontend)

`solidus_starter_frontend` is a new starter storefront for [Solidus][solidus].

This project aims to deliver a modern, minimal, semantic, and easy to extend
codebase for a more efficient bootstrapping experience.

**DISCLAIMER**: some Solidus extensions (the ones that depend on Solidus
Frontend) will not work with this project because they rely on defacing some
views items that don't exist here.

## Objectives
We aim to deliver:
- a minimal, semantic and accessible HTML skeleton
- a reusable component based architecture
- simple SASS styling strictly based on BEM
- the elimination of jQuery as a dependency by rewriting frontend functionality
in vanilla JavaScript

All of this while keeping and improving on the functionality of the current
[Solidus][solidus] frontend subcomponent.

## Installation

By default, the `solidus` gem also includes the standard frontend via the
`solidus_frontend` gem. To make this template work, you need to exclude
`solidus_frontend` gem and manually include the rest of the Solidus
components.

### For a new store

Just run:

```bash
rails new store --skip-javascript
cd store
bundle add solidus_core solidus_backend solidus_api solidus_sample
bin/rails generate solidus:install --auto-accept
```

Please note that `--auto-accept` will add
[Solidus Auth Devise](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus_auth_devise)
to your application. SolidusStarterFrontend requires the application to include
the gem.

### For existing stores

In your `Gemfile` replace:

```ruby
gem 'solidus'
```

with:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_core'
gem 'solidus_api'
gem 'solidus_backend'
gem 'solidus_sample'
```

And replace all the references of the string `Spree::Frontend::Config` in your
project with `SolidusStarterFrontend::Config`.

You'll also need to make sure that
[Solidus Auth Devise](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus_auth_devise)
is installed in your application.

### Frontend installation

You can copy the starter frontend files to your project:

```shell
$ LOCATION="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solidusio/solidus_starter_frontend/main/template.rb" bin/rails app:template
```

These commands will copy the frontend views, assets, routes, controllers, and
specs to your project. You can change easily anything that we created; this
gives you a lot of freedom of customization.

It is not possible right now to generate a new Rails app with the template, i.e.
run `rails new --template=URL` since the template expects Solidus to be
installed on the app.

In addition, please note that the command will add Solidus Auth Devise
frontend components to your app. At the moment, you will need to manually
remove the gem and its frontend components if you don't need them.

Finally, please note that since the starter frontend is a Rails application
template, it doesn't have the capability to automatically update your
storefront code whenever the template is updated.
